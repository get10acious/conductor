# Conductor

**Measure twice, code once.**

Conductor is an AI coding assistant extension that enables **Context-Driven Development**. It turns your AI assistant into a proactive project manager that follows a strict protocol to specify, plan, and implement software features and bug fixes.

Instead of just writing code, Conductor ensures a consistent, high-quality lifecycle for every task: **Context -> Spec & Plan -> Implement**.

The philosophy behind Conductor is simple: control your code. By treating context as a managed artifact alongside your code, you transform your repository into a single source of truth that drives every agent interaction with deep, persistent project awareness.

## Features

- **Plan before you build**: Create specs and plans that guide the agent for new and existing codebases.
- **Maintain context**: Ensure AI follows style guides, tech stack choices, and product goals.
- **Iterate safely**: Review plans before code is written, keeping you firmly in the loop.
- **Work as a team**: Set project-level context for your product, tech stack, and workflow preferences that become a shared foundation for your team.
- **Build on existing projects**: Intelligent initialization for both new (Greenfield) and existing (Brownfield) projects.
- **Smart revert**: A git-aware revert command that understands logical units of work (tracks, phases, tasks) rather than just commit hashes.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Install the Conductor plugin using the `/plugin` slash command inside Claude Code:

```
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add get10acious/conductor

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install conductor@get10acious-conductor
```

Or use the interactive plugin manager by typing `/plugin` and navigating to the Marketplaces tab.

### Codex CLI (OpenAI)

Install the Conductor prompt files by copying them to your Codex prompts directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/get10acious/conductor.git /tmp/conductor

# Create prompts directory if needed
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts

# Copy the prompt files
cp /tmp/conductor/prompts/*.md ~/.codex/prompts/
```

Commands are invoked with the `/prompts:` prefix (e.g., `/prompts:conductor-setup`).

See [CODEX.md](CODEX.md) for detailed Codex CLI documentation.

### Gemini CLI

Install the Conductor extension by running the following command from your terminal:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/get10acious/conductor
```

> **Note:** The `--auto-update` flag is available but not recommended. It causes Gemini CLI to automatically apply any future update to this repository into your agent's context without review. Pin to a specific release tag for production use.

## Usage

Conductor is designed to manage the entire lifecycle of your development tasks.

**Note on Token Consumption:** Conductor's context-driven approach involves reading and analyzing your project's context, specifications, and plans. This can lead to increased token consumption, especially in larger projects or during extensive planning and implementation phases.

### 1. Set Up the Project (Run Once)

When you run `/conductor:setup`, Conductor helps you define the core components of your project context. This context is then used for building new components or features by you or anyone on your team.

- **Product**: Define project context (e.g. users, product goals, high-level features).
- **Product guidelines**: Define standards (e.g. prose style, brand messaging, visual identity).
- **Tech stack**: Configure technical preferences (e.g. language, database, frameworks).
- **Workflow**: Set team preferences (e.g. TDD, commit strategy). Uses [workflow.md](templates/workflow.md) as a customizable template.

**Generated Artifacts:**

- `conductor/product.md`
- `conductor/product-guidelines.md`
- `conductor/tech-stack.md`
- `conductor/workflow.md`
- `conductor/code_styleguides/`
- `conductor/tracks.md`

```bash
/conductor:setup
```

### 2. Start a New Track (Feature or Bug)

When you're ready to take on a new feature or bug fix, run `/conductor:new-track`. This initializes a **track** — a high-level unit of work. Conductor helps you generate two critical artifacts:

- **Specs**: The detailed requirements for the specific job. What are we building and why?
- **Plan**: An actionable to-do list containing phases, tasks, and sub-tasks.

**Generated Artifacts:**

- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md`
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/metadata.json`

```bash
/conductor:new-track
# OR with a description
/conductor:new-track "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page"
```

### 3. Implement the Track

Once you approve the plan, run `/conductor:implement`. Your coding agent then works through the `plan.md` file, checking off tasks as it completes them.

**Updated Artifacts:**

- `conductor/tracks.md` (Status updates)
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md` (Status updates)
- Project context files (Synchronized on completion)

```bash
/conductor:implement
```

Conductor will:

1. Select the next pending task.
2. Follow the defined workflow (e.g., TDD: Write Test -> Fail -> Implement -> Pass).
3. Update the status in the plan as it progresses.
4. **Verify Progress**: Guide you through a manual verification step at the end of each phase to ensure everything works as expected.

During implementation, you can also:

- **Check status**: Get a high-level overview of your project's progress.
  ```bash
  /conductor:status
  ```
- **Revert work**: Undo a feature or a specific task if needed.
  ```bash
  /conductor:revert
  ```

## Automatic Skill

When using Claude Code, Conductor includes an automatic skill that activates when:

- A `conductor/` directory exists in the project
- You're working on tasks from a track's `plan.md`
- You mention "tracks", "specs", or "plans" in your requests

This skill ensures Claude follows Conductor's TDD workflow and properly tracks task completion without needing explicit commands.
